    geometric_median(reports; tol=1e-7, maxiter=1000)

Compute the geometric median of the rows in `reports` using Weiszfeldâ€™s algorithm
(minimizing sum of Euclidean distances).

- `reports` is an `n x m` matrix, where each of the `n` rows is an `m`-dimensional point.
- `tol` is the stopping tolerance for the iterative method.
- `maxiter` is the maximum number of iterations.

Returns a 1D vector of length `m`.
