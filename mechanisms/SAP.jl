# Sort each column, select the highest row where the sum is less than the
# budget. Total will not necessarily add up to budget. For monotonically
# increasing preferences or preferences where the peak is greater than the
# budget, this results in pareto-inefficient allocations. The SAPScaled
# mechanism is the same but scales the results so they sum to the budget.
